- 👋 Hi, I’m Priscila!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning languages and developing exciting projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development fundamentals. I have finished a Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp!
- 💞️ I’m currently working a full time job, so I´ll be focusing on that, while preparing a few small projects. For that reason, you may see my GitHub a bit quieter.
- 📫 How to reach me: pguillen.oliv@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I tried being a lawyer and an administrative assistant before. That went well. LOL
